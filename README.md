# Portfolio

I have included four source codes into my portfolio to demonstrate my coding abilities in Python, R and SQL (PostgreSQL). The first item is a multiplayer quiz game using Python which allows multiple users to take a very simple mathematics quiz, and which calculates each userâ€™s score. I have included a 10min video which demonstrates how it works. The second item is a library system using Python which allows users and books to be registered into a library. The users can then take multiple books out of the library, which is recorded onto the system as a loan, and then return them to the library at a later stage. I have again included a 15min video to demonstrate how this works. The third item is a machine learning mini project using R, which predicts the quality of red and white wine using four classification algorithms, namely,  Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. I have included a report which outlines the findings. The fourth item is a database which allows customers to purchase an online item from a franchise of stores. I have used both stored procedures and functions to create this database. Customers can register themselves and then purchase an item from any of the available stores.
